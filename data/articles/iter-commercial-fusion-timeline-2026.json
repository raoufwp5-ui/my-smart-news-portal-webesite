Location: Cadarache, France.\n\nHistorians will likely look back at this day as the moment humanity graduated to a Type 1 Civilization. After decades of delays, billions over budget, and immense skepticism, the **ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor)** has officially achieved \"First Plasma.\"\n\nIt is not just a science experiment. It is the proof that we can replicate the power source of the Sun on Earth. The **ITER commercial fusion timeline** has shifted from \"always 30 years away\" to \"happening now.\"\n\n### 🔥 Fusion vs. Fission: What's the Difference?\nTo understand the hype, you must understand the physics.\n*   **Fission (Old Nuclear)**: Splits heavy atoms (Uranium). \n    *   *Pros*: Zero carbon. \n    *   *Cons*: Radioactive waste that lasts 10,000 years; risk of meltdown (Chernobyl/Fukushima).\n*   **Fusion (The New Holy Grail)**: Smashes light atoms (Hydrogen isotopes) together.\n    *   *Fuel*: Deuterium (from seawater) and Tritium.\n    *   *Waste*: Helium (safe, inert gas).\n    *   *Risk*: **Zero**. If something breaks, the plasma just cools down and stops. No explosion.\n\n### 🏗️ The Engineering Marvel\nITER is the most complex machine ever built by human hands. \n*   **Weight**: 23,000 tonnes (3x the Eiffel Tower).\n*   **Magnets**: Superconducting coils cooled to -269°C (colder than deep space).\n*   **Core Heat**: The plasma reaches **150 million degrees Celsius** (10x hotter than the core of the Sun).\n\nThe goal of 2026 is data. The reactor isn't feeding the grid yet; it is proving that we can hold this superheated jelly of energy in place using magnetic fields without melting the walls.\n\n### 🏎️ The Race: Private vs Public\nWhile ITER is the giant government project (EU, US, China, Russia, Japan, Korea, India), private startups are moving faster.\n\n**The Competitors in 2026:**\n1.  **Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS)**: Using new high-temperature superconductors to build smaller, cheaper reactors.\n2.  **Helion Energy**: Backed by massive tech investment, aiming for a different method (pulsed non-ignition fusion).\n\n> \"ITER is the science project. Apps like Helion are the commercial product,\" says energy analyst [Name].\n\n### ⏳ When Will My Lights Be Powered by Fusion?\nThe timeline is accelerating.\n*   **2026**: ITER First Plasma (Done).\n*   **2029**: First \"Net Energy\" gain (getting more power out than we put in).\n*   **2033**: DEMO (Demonstration Power Plant) construction begins.\n*   **2030s**: First commercial fusion electron hits the grid.\n\n## 🏁 Conclusion\nWe are not quite there yet. You cannot plug your toaster into a fusion reactor today. But the **ITER commercial fusion timeline** confirms that the physics works. The rest is just engineering. Climate change has met its match.\n\n## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n### Is fusion energy radioactive?\nThe reaction itself produces neutrons, which makes the reactor walls slightly radioactive over time. However, this waste is low-level and safe to recycle after 100 years, unlike fission waste which is dangerous for millennia.\n\n### Can a fusion reactor explode?\nNo. It is physically impossible. A fusion reactor contains only a few grams of fuel at any time. If the containment fails, the reaction simply stops instantly.\n\n### How much does the fuel cost?\nIdeally, it's free. Deuterium is extracted from seawater. A bathtub of water and two laptop batteries worth of lithium could provide enough energy for one person's entire lifetime."
