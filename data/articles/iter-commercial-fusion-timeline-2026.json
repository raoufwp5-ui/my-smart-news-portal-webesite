In a monumental event in Cadarache, France, the **ITER** (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) successfully generated its first sustained super-heated plasma.\n\n### 🔥 Why This Matters (Fusion Energy Explained)\nCurrent nuclear power (Fission) splits atoms, creating radioactive waste. Fusion *smashes* atoms together, like the sun.\n*   **Fuel**: Hydrogen isotopes (basically water).\n*   **Waste**: Helium (safe gas).\n*   **Risk**: Zero meltdown risk.\n\n> \"We have bottled a star,\" announced Director General Pietro Barabaschi.\n\n### The Timeline: ITER Commercial Fusion Timeline\nDon't unplug your solar panels just yet.\n*   **2026**: First Plasma (Achieved).\n*   **2029**: Full Power Operations.\n*   **2035**: DEMO plant construction (The first commercial prototype).\n\n## Conclusion\nThe **ITER commercial fusion timeline** is long, but the destination is infinite, clean energy. 2026 will be remembered as the year we finally verified the physics."
