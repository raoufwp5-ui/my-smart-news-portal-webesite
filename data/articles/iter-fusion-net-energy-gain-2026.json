They had just watched a monitor flash a single number: **Q = 1.1**.\n\nFor the first time in human history, a man-made fusion reaction has generated more energy than was pumped in to start it. The dream of unlimited, carbon-free energy is no longer science fiction. It is engineering.\n\n### ⚛️ The Breakthrough\n\nThe International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) has been under construction for decades, plagued by delays and cost overruns. But today, the massive Tokamak device heated a plasma of deuterium and tritium to 150 million degrees Celsius—ten times hotter than the core of the Sun.\n\nFor 600 seconds, the plasma burned self-sustainably, releasing 550 Megawatts of thermal power from an input of 500 Megawatts.\n\n### 🌍 Changing the Geopolitical Map\n\nUnlike uranium fission (traditional nuclear power), fusion produces no long-lived radioactive waste and carries zero risk of meltdown. The fuel is found in seawater. \n\n\"The resource wars are over,\" declared French President Macron. \"A single glass of ocean water can now power a city for a year.\"\n\n### ⚡ When Will We Use It?\n\nDon't unplug your solar panels just yet. ITER is an experiment, not a power plant. The next step is **DEMO**, a prototype commercial reactor slated for 2035. However, private fusion companies like Helion and CFS say they can piggyback on today's data to put fusion on the grid by 2029.\n\nRegardless of the timeline, the physics is settled. The fossil fuel era has been given an expiration date."
