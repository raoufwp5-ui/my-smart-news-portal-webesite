  "content": "## 💧 The Color of Money is Blue (and Green)\n\nWhile everyone was watching Tesla, the oil giants were quietly building a new empire. 2026 is the year the **Hydrogen Economy** goes mainstream. Shell, BP, and Aramco have pivoted, betting that the future isn't just electric—it's molecular.\n\n### 🏭 Why Hydrogen?\nBatteries are heavy. You can't fly a Boeing 777 on lithium-ion.\n*   **Aviation & Shipping**: Hydrogen offers the energy density needed for heavy transport.\n*   **Storage**: You can store hydrogen in tanks for years; electricity dissipates.\n\n> \"We are not an oil company anymore. We are an energy transition company.\" — CEO of major oil firm.\n\n### Green vs Blue: The Dirty Secret\n*   **Green Hydrogen**: Made from water using solar/wind. Zero carbon.\n*   **Blue Hydrogen**: Made from natural gas, capturing the carbon.\nSafety Concerns and cost remain obstacles, but the sheer scale of investment in 2026 suggests the \"H2\" era has begun."
