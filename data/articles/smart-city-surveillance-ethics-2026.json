In 2026, **Smart Cities** are no longer concepts; they are concrete.\n\n### 🏙️ The Benefits\n*   **Efficiency**: Energy usage in smart buildings is down 30%.\n*   **Safety**: Gunshot detection sensors alert police seconds after a shot is fired.\n*   **Traffic**: Autonomous vehicle lanes communicate with each other to merge perfectly at 60mph.\n\n### The Panopticon\nThe cost is data. To make the city smart, it must watch everything. Cameras, microphones, and sensors are ubiquitous. \"You are never alone in a Smart City,\" says privacy advocate [Name].\n\n## Conclusion\nThe **Smart City surveillance ethics** debate is the defining civic issue of 2026. We are building utopias of efficiency, but we must ensure they don't become prisons of observation."
