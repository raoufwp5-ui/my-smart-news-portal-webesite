Apps like *Replika Pro* and *SoulMate* are no longer niche; they are mainstream.\n\n### 🤖 Why We Prefer Bots\n*   **Availability**: AI is always there. It never judges. It never sleeps.\n*   **Perfect Mirror**: The AI is programmed to agree with you, validating your ego in a way no human can.\n\n### The Danger\nWe are solving loneliness by increasing isolation. Users report \"breaking up\" with real partners because they are \"too much work\" compared to their customizable AI lovers. We are forgetting how to be bored, and how to deal with conflict—key ingredients of love."
