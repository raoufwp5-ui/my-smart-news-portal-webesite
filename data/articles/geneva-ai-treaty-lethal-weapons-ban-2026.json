    "content": "<h2>Peace for Our Time? The Machines Have Been Leashed.</h2><p>The nightmare scenario of 'Killer Robots' deciding who lives and dies without human intervention has been officially averted—at least on paper. At 10:00 AM CET in Geneva, the United States and China, co-signatories to the new UN Resolution 2884, formally agreed to a complete moratorium on 'Category 6' autonomous weapons.</p><h3>What is Banned?</h3><p>The treaty specifically targets 'fully autonomous lethal systems'—drones, tanks, or turrets that can identify, target, and engage a human combatant without a 'man-in-the-loop' authorization. Semi-autonomous systems, which fly themselves but require a human to pull the trigger, remain legal.</p><p>'We are drawing a red line for humanity,' said US Secretary of State Pete Buttigieg. 'War is a human tragedy, and the decision to take a life must remain a human burden. We cannot outsource our morality to an algorithm along with our supply chains.'</p><h3>The Verification Challenge</h3><p>Critics point out that enforcing such a ban is technologically nearly impossible. How do you inspect code? A software update can turn a legal drone into an illegal assassin in seconds. The treaty establishes a new 'International AI Atomic Energy Agency' (IAIAEA) with the power to inspect military server farms, but skepticism remains high.</p><p>'It's a gentleman's agreement in a world of street fighters,' argues defense analyst Sarah Connor. 'Unless we have full access to the source code of every military neural network, this is just symbolism. But symbolism matters.'</p><h3>Global Reaction</h3><p>The European Union, which has been pushing for this ban for a decade, hailed the accord as a 'victory for civilization'. Meanwhile, Russia and India have notably refused to sign, citing 'national sovereignty concerns' and the need to maintain strategic deterrence.</p><p>For the average citizen, the Geneva Accord brings a sigh of relief. The fear of 'Swarm Warfare'—thousands of cheap AI drones hunting people like locusts—has been the defining anxiety of 2026. Today, the world stepped back from the brink.</p>"
