The continent is not \"catching up\"; in many ways, it is leading.\n\n### 📱 Mobile First\nThere are no bank branches in rural Kenya. There are phones.\n*   **Super Apps**: Apps like M-Pesa have evolved into \"Everything Apps\" for loans, insurance, and medical bills.\n*   **DeFi**: Decentralized Finance is providing loans to farmers who have no credit history but have a transaction history on the blockchain.\n\n### The Investment Rush\nSilicon Valley VCs are bored with AI wrappers in San Francisco. They are flying to Lagos. The demographic dividend (young population) combined with digital adoption makes Africa the highest-growth market on Earth in 2026."
