  "content": "## 👔 The CEO is a Freelancer\n\nThe Gig Economy used to be about Uber drivers. In 2026, it's about Chief Financial Officers. The **Fractional Executive** trend has exploded, reshaping how companies are built.\n\n### 💼 How It Works\nInstead of paying a CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) $200k a year + benefits, a startup hires a \"Fractional CMO\" for $5k a month. That CMO works for 5 different startups simultaneously.\n*   **Company Benefit**: incredible talent at a fraction of the cost.\n*   **Exec Benefit**: Diversity of work and total freedom.\n\n### The Death of Loyalty?\nThe corporate ladder is gone. It's a corporate lattice. Professional networks and personal branding are now more important than a resume.\n\n## Conclusion\n**Gig Economy 2.0** is white-collar and high-status. In 2026, having one job is seen as a risk. Portfolio careers are the new safety net."
