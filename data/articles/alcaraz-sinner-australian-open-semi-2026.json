In a match that will be replayed on highlight reels for decades, the Spaniard edged out the Italian World No. 1 in a five-set war of attrition at Rod Laver Arena.\n\n**Final Score:** 6-4, 5-7, 7-6(4), 4-6, 7-5.\n\n### ⚡ The Turning Point\n\nThe match was neck-and-neck until the fifth set. Sinner, looking physically fresher, was serving at 4-4. Alcaraz, who had been cramping early in the fourth, suddenly found a second wind. Unleashing a blistering 100mph forehand winner down the line, he secured the crucial break point that would eventually serve him the match.\n\n\"I don't know how I did it,\" Alcaraz admitted on court, covered in sweat. \"Jannik pushes me to the limit of my humanity. Every point is a battle.\"\n\n### 🛸 The Drone Incident\n\nThe drama wasn't just on the baseline. In the middle of the fourth set, play was halted when a rogue camera drone—part of the new \"Immersive Broadcast\" system—malfunctioned and hovered dangerously low over the net. \n\nUmpire Mohamed Lahyani was forced to suspend play for 10 minutes while technicians reset the unit. While the crowd booed the tech glitch, both players used the break to refuel, adding a strange tactical pause to the momentum.\n\n### 🇺🇸 The Final Challenge\n\nAlcaraz now advances to Sunday's final, where he will face the explosive American **Ben Shelton**, who dismissed Holger Rune in straight sets yesterday. \n\n\"Ben is serving bombs right now,\" Alcaraz noted. \"I will need to rest, eat, and maybe sleep for 24 hours to be ready.\"\n\nFor tennis fans, the rivalry between Alcaraz and Sinner—now tied at 8-8 in head-to-heads—has officially cemented itself as the successor to Nadal vs. Federer. We are witnessing greatness in real-time."
