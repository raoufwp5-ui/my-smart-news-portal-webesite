Minimalist, efficient, and backed by the Supercharger network.\n    \n2.  **BYD Dolphin MAX**:\n    *   **Price**: $19,500 (after tariffs)\n    *   **Range**: 300 miles\n    *   **Verdict**: Feature-rich but faces political headwinds in US/EU markets.\n\n3.  **Volkswagen ID.2all**:\n    *   **Price**: $26,500\n    *   **Verdict**: The safe choice. Good build quality, familiar design, but software lags behind.\n\n## 📉 Battery Prices Plunge\nThe secret sauce is Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries. Costs have dropped below $60/kWh in 2026. This allows manufacturers to sell huge volumes at razor-thin margins.\n\n### The Losers\nAs prices drop, startups like Rivian and Lucid are feeling the squeeze. Without the scale of Tesla or BYD, they cannot compete on price. Expect consolidation or buyouts by the end of the year.\n\n## Conclusion\nFor the consumer, this war is a blessing. The **best affordable electric cars of 2026** are better, cheaper, and more plentiful than ever. The internal combustion engine isn't dying; it's being priced out of existence."
