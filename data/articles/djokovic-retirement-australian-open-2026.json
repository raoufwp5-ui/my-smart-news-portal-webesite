Novak Djokovic, 38 years old and fighting time as much as his opponent, had just lost in four sets to the young Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz. But the score didn't matter.</p><p>Fighting back tears, the Serbian legend took the microphone. 'My friends,' he began, his voice cracking. 'The tank is finally empty. This was my last dance.'</p><h3>A Resume of Immortality</h3><p>Djokovic leaves the sport with statistics that look like typos. 26 Grand Slam titles. 420 weeks at World Number 1. 10 Australian Open trophies. He outlasted Federer. He outlasted Nadal. He played into a new generation and beat them too, until today.</p><p>'He is the greatest machine the sport has ever seen,' said John McEnroe on commentary. 'We called him the Joker, but his discipline was no joke. We will not see another mental giant like him for a hundred years.'</p><h3>The Final Match</h3><p>The match itself was a passing of the torch. Alcaraz, 22, played with the explosive power that Djokovic once possessed, while Novak relied on his legendary tactical mind. There were flashes of brilliance—a cross-court backhand winner in the second set that turned back the clock—but the physical toll was evident.</p><p>'Carlos is the future,' Djokovic said, embracing his rival at the net. 'I leave the sport in good hands.'</p><h3>What's Next for Nole?</h3><p>Djokovic has hinted at a future in coaching and expanding his PTPA (Professional Tennis Players Association) work to ensure fair pay for lower-ranked players. 'I am not leaving tennis,' he promised. 'I am just leaving the baseline.'</p><p>As he walked off the court for the final time, stopping to touch the blue hardcourt that defined his career, tennis didn't just lose a player. It lost its final Titan. The Big Three era is officially, finally, over.</p>"
