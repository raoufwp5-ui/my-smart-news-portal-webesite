Apple has announced that its new **Vision Air** smart glasses have surpassed **10 million units sold** in their first week of availability, shattering the records set by the iPhone 15 and the original iPad.\n\nStores from Tokyo to New York have seen lines wrapping around blocks, reminiscent of the mid-2010s iPhone craze. \n\n### 🌌 Why This Product? Why Now?\n\nThe original Vision Pro (2024) was a marvel, but it was heavy, expensive ($3,500), and isolating. The Vision Air is different:\n\n*   **Form Factor:** Looks like designer sunglasses (partnership with Ray-Ban parent EssilorLuxottica).\n*   **Weight:** Only 75 grams.\n*   **Price:** $1,499 (Premium) / $999 (Standard).\n\n\"It's the first AR device you can wear to a dinner party without looking like a cyborg,\" says tech reviewer Marques Brownlee (MKBHD). \"Apple waited until the tech disappeared, and that's why they won.\"\n\n### 📱 The 'Killer App': LifeOS\n\nThe driving force behind the sales isn't games or movies; it's the new **LifeOS**. \n\nThe glasses overlay helpful data on the real world: navigation arrows on the sidewalk, translation subtitles floating next to a foreigner's face, and nutrition info hovering over food items in a grocery store. It effectively replaces the need to check a phone screen 100 times a day.\n\n### 📉 Panic at Meta?\n\nMeta (Facebook), which has poured billions into its Orion prototype, is reportedly in crisis mode. While their Quest line dominates VR gaming, they have yet to produce a consumer-ready AR glass that matches Apple's sleekness. \n\nInternal leaks suggest Mark Zuckerberg has ordered a \"Code Red\" to accelerate the launch of **Meta Horizon Glass** from 2027 to late 2026.\n\n### 🔮 What Comes Next?\n\nWith 10 million users now walking around with cameras and sensors on their faces, privacy concerns are resurfacing. Apple highlights its \"Privacy LED\" that glows when recording, but critics say it's not enough.\n\nRegardless of the debate, the market has spoken. The era of staring down at a black rectangle in your hand is ending. The era of looking at the world—augmented—has begun."
