It was cramped, smelled like ozone, and you had to pee in a vacuum tube. \n\nIn December 2026, that changes. The **Voyager Station** has opened its airlock doors. It is the first commercial entity in orbit designed for *comfort*.\n\n### 🌌 The Gravity of the Situation\nThe biggest innovation isn't the view; it's the spin. \nThe station is a giant wheel. As it rotates, centrifugal force creates **Artificial Gravity** on the outer rim. \n*   **Level**: 1/6th Earth Gravity (Lunar equivalent).\n*   **Effect**: You can walk. You can shower. You can pour wine into a glass. It eliminates the nausea of zero-G.\n\n### 🥂 What Do You Get for $5 Million?\nThe price tag is astronomical, but so is the service.\n*   **Transport**: Launch on a SpaceX Starship (VIP config).\n*   **Dining**: The first Michelin-starred meal served in orbit (freeze-dried is banned).\n*   **Activities**: Low-gravity basketball courts and spacewalks.\n\n### 🚀 The Business Model\nOrbital Assembly Corporation (OAC) isn't just selling vacations. They are selling specific modules to governments who can't afford their own space program. \n\"It's a business park in the sky,\" says CEO [Name].\n\n## 🏁 Conclusion\nThe **Voyager Station hotel opening** is the \"Wright Brothers moment\" for tourism. Today it is for billionaires. But remember, a flight from London to New York used to cost a year's salary. In 2026, the door to the cosmos is unlocked.\n\n## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n### Is it safe?\nSpace is never 100% safe. Risks include micrometeoroids and radiation. The station is heavily shielded, but waivers are required.\n\n### How long is the stay?\nStandard package is 3 days / 2 nights. Longer stays are discouraged due to radiation exposure limits.\n\n### Can I see the Great Wall of China?\nYes. You orbit the Earth every 90 minutes. You see 16 sunrises and sunsets a day."
