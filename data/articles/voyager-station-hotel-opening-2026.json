But in late 2026, the **Voyager Station** isn't a render; it's a destination.\n\n### 🚀 The Experience\nThis isn't just floating in a tin can.\n*   **Gravity**: The station spins to create 1/6th Earth gravity (Moon gravity). You can walk, jump high, and pour a drink.\n*   **Luxury**: 5-star dining, gyms, and spacewalks.\n\n### The Price Tag\nSpace tourism remains a playground for the ultra-rich. At $5 million a ticket, it is exclusive. But analysts predict that by 2035, the price could drop to the cost of a luxury cruise ($50,000).\n\n## Conclusion\nThe **Voyager Station hotel opening** marks the end of the \"Astronaut Era\" and the beginning of the \"Passenger Era.\" Space is open for business."
