Seismologists in Mexico City recorded a minor tremor at 9:53 PM local time—the exact moment the ball hit the back of the net.\n\nIn what will surely go down as one of the greatest opening matches in FIFA history, host nation Mexico has defeated the heavily favored French side 2-1, kicking off the expanded 2026 World Cup in spectacular fashion.\n\n### 🏟️ The Fortress Azteca\n\nBefore a ball was even kicked, the atmosphere was suffocating. The refurbished Estadio Azteca, now seating 105,000, was a sea of green. The noise level during the anthem hit 115 decibels. \n\nFrance, led by captain Kylian Mbappé (now 27 and in his prime), looked rattled. The altitude of Mexico City (7,200 ft) is a notorious lung-burner, and *Les Bleus* looked heavy-legged from the first whistle.\n\n### ⚔️ The Match: A Tale of Two Halves\n\n**First Half**: France asserted dominance early. In the 23rd minute, a slick passing triangle between Camavinga and Tchouaméni found Mbappé, who slotted it past Ochoa (yes, he is *still* playing at 40) with surgical precision. 1-0 France. The silence in the Azteca was deafening.\n\n**Second Half**: Mexico manager Jaime Lozano made a tactical switch, bringing on swift winger Diego Lainez. The game turned on its head. \n\n*   **67th Minute**: Hirving Lozano breaks free down the right, crosses, and Edson Álvarez headers it home. 1-1. Bedlam.\n*   **90+3 Minute**: The moment of magic. With France pushing for a winner, Mexico countered. A long ball found Santiago Giménez. He cut inside Saliba, looked up, and curled a masterpiece into the top corner.\n\n> \"I didn't think. I just hit it. Then I saw the net ripple and I think I blacked out.\" — *Santiago Giménez, Man of the Match*\n\n## 🌍 The 48-Team Experiment Begins\n\nThis match was also the debut of FIFA's controversial 48-team format. Critics said it would dilute the quality. They said the group stages would be boring. \n\nIf this game is any indication, they were wrong. The intensity was playoff-level from the start. With 3-team groups (a format FIFA reverted to at the last minute), every game is do-or-die. A loss here puts France on the brink of a humiliating early exit.\n\n### 📊 Key Stats\n\n*   **Possession**: France 58% - Mexico 42%\n*   **Shots on Target**: Mexico 6 - France 4\n*   **Distance Covered**: Mexico 112km - France 104km\n\n## 🔮 What It Means\n\nFor Mexico, this is more than three points. It is belief. They have beaten a European giant on home soil. The \"Fifth Game\" curse (never getting past the Round of 16) suddenly feels like an old ghost story.\n\nFor France, the pressure is now immense. They must beat South Korea in their next match or face elimination. The World Cup has arrived, and it is already refusing to follow the script."
