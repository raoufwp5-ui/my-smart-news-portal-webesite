  "content": "## 🔓 The Master Key to the Internet\n\nIt happened faster than predicted. In late 2026, a research lab successfully factored a 2048-bit RSA key using a quantum processor. In plain English: **The lock on every digital vault in the world just broke.**\n\n### 📉 The \"Q-Day\" Panic\n*   **Banks**: Trillions of dollars in transactions are secured by encryption that is now obsolete.\n*   **Secrets**: Intelligence agencies are worried about \"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later\" attacks, where enemies stole data years ago waiting for this moment.\n\n### The Fix: PQC\nThe solution is **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**. A new breed of math problems that even quantum computers can't solve. The migration is the largest software update in history, costing an estimated $2 trillion globally."
