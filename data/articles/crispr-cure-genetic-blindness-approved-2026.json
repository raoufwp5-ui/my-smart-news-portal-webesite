    "content": "## 👁️ A Miracle of Science\n\n**GENEVA, January 22, 2026** — For millennia, curing the blind was the province of prophets and myths. Today, it became a medical procedure you can book on a Tuesday. \n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), in coordination with the FDA and EMA, has granted full approval to **Lumina-9**, a revolutionary CRISPR-Cas13 gene therapy developed by Swiss biotech firm **GeneSight**. The therapy effectively edits the DNA of retinal cells in living patients, correcting the mutation responsible for Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) and Retinitis Pigmentosa.\n\n### 🧬 How It Works\n\nUnlike previous treatments that slowed degeneration, Lumina-9 reverses it. \n1.  A modified, harmless virus carrier is injected directly into the eye.\n2.  It delivers the CRISPR molecular payload to the photoreceptor cells.\n3.  The \"molecular scissors\" locate the broken gene sequence and perform a precise \"cut and paste\" repair.\n4.  Within weeks, the dormant cells begin producing the proteins necessary to capture light.\n\n### 🌟 'I Saw My Daughter's Face'\n\nIn the final Phase 3 trials, the results were described by independent auditors as \"startling.\" \n\nMichael Tan, 34, born totally blind, was one of the first participants. \"It didn't happen all at once,\" he recalls. \"At first, it was just flashes of light. Then shapes. Then colors. Three months after the injection, I saw my daughter's face for the first time. She's six years old. I always knew she was beautiful, but seeing it... there are no words.\"\n\n### 💰 The Cost of Sight\n\nThe miracle comes with a price tag: **$1.5 million USD** per eye. This has sparked an immediate debate about equitable access. \n\n\"Science has done its job; now politics must do ours,\" stated Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO. \"We cannot allow vision to become a luxury good for the ultra-wealthy.\"\n\nIn response, a coalition of insurance providers and government health services in the EU and Canada has already announced coverage plans. In the US, Congress is debating the \"2026 Cures Act\" to subsidize the treatment for low-income patients.\n\nWaitlists are already spanning into 2028. But for millions living in darkness, the waiting list is a small price to pay for the promise of a sunrise."
