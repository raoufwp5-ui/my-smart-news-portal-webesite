NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, flanked by Mexican business tycoons and legends like Eduardo Nájera, made the announcement that changes the geography of American sports forever.\n\n\"The game of basketball knows no borders,\" Silver proclaimed. \"It is my distinct honor to welcome the **Mexico City Capitanes** as the 31st franchise of the National Basketball Association.\"\n\n### 🏟️ A New Home Court Advantage\n\nThe Capitanes, who have been playing in the G-League as a trial run, will step up to the big leagues starting in the **2027-28 season**. \n\nThey bring with them one of the most intimidating home-court advantages in sports: **Altitude**. \n\n*   **Denver:** 5,280 feet above sea level.\n*   **Salt Lake City:** 4,226 feet.\n*   **Mexico City:** **7,350 feet.**\n\n\"Visiting teams are going to need oxygen tanks on the bench,\" laughed ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith. \"This is going to be the toughest road trip in the NBA schedule.\"\n\n### 💰 The Business of Expansion\n\nThe expansion fee—the price paid to join the exclusive club—was a staggering **$4.5 billion**. The ownership group, led by billionaire Carlos Slim Domit, is betting that tapping into the Latin American market of 600 million people will pay off handsomely in merchandise and TV rights.\n\n### 🌍 What About Seattle and Vegas?\n\nThe announcement leaves one spot open. The NBA has stated it wants 32 teams to balance the conferences. Seattle (Supersonics return) and Las Vegas remain the heavy favorites for the 32nd spot, with an announcement expected later this year.\n\nBut today belongs to Mexico. As the logo was unveiled—an Aztec warrior holding a basketball—the streets of Polanco erupted in celebration. The NBA is no longer just North American in name; it is truly continental."
