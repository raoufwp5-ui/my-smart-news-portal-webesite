The factory, a sprawling complex covering 400 acres in Maharashtra, represents a **$4 billion investment** and is central to Tesla's \"Master Plan Part 4.\"\n\n### ⚡ Enter the Model 2\n\nThe star of the show wasn't the factory, but the car it will build: the **Tesla Model 2**. \n\n*   **Price:** ₹20 Lakh (~$25,000 USD)\n*   **Range:** 450km (Standard Range)\n*   **Battery:** LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) cells sourced locally.\n\nDesigned to compete directly with BYD's dominance in the affordable segment, the Model 2 strips away luxury features (no glass roof, fabric seats) but keeps the core Tesla software stack and Supercharging compatibility.\n\n### 📉 The BYD Rivalry\n\nThis move is a direct counter-attack against Chinese giant BYD, which captured 22% of the Indian EV market in 2025. \"Tesla realized they cannot win on volume with $50,000 cars,\" explains auto analyst Rajeev Sharma. \"Giga India is their war room for the budget segment. If they can win in India, they can win in Africa and Latin America.\"\n\n### 🔋 Local Supply Chain\n\nCrucially, 90% of the components for Giga India are sourced domestically. Tata Electronics is supplying the chips, and a new lithium refinery in Gujarat will provide the battery grade material. This circumvents high import tariffs that previously kept Tesla out of the market.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, joining via hologram, hailed the opening as a victory for the \"Make in India\" initiative. \"We are no longer just buying technology; we are building it for the world,\" he stated.\n\nAs the first Model 2 rolled off the assembly line, painted in a saffron orange, it signaled a new chapter in the global EV race. The battleground has shifted from the highways of California to the chaotic, vibrant streets of Mumbai."
