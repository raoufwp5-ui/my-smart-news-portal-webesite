It turned out to be seismic. \n\nSpaceX, the company that privatized the cosmos, finally went public today under the ticker **SPCX**. By the time the opening bell finished ringing, the old financial world order had been incinerated.\n\n### 📈 The Numbers\n\n*   **Opening Price**: $450/share\n*   **Closing Price**: $890/share\n*   **Market Cap**: $5.2 Trillion\n\nTo put that in perspective: SpaceX is now worth more than Apple and Microsoft *combined*. It took 20 minutes for the trading computers at the NYSE to catch up with the orders, forcing three separate volatility halts.\n\n### 💰 Why the Hype?\n\nAnalysts say this isn't about rockets. It's about **Starlink**. \n\n\"SpaceX isn't an aerospace company anymore; it's the world's only ISP,\" says bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone. \"With Starlink V3 now serving 1 billion users and the Mars Colonial Transporter (MCT) accepting cargo bookings, investors aren't buying a stock. They are buying shares in the future of the human species.\"\n\n### 👨‍🚀 The Trillionaire Era\n\nWith his 42% stake, Elon Musk's personal net worth ballooned to roughly $2.1 Trillion today. He posted a single tweet following the close: *\"Funding secured. Mars, here we come.\"*\n\n### 📉 The Ripple Effect\n\nWhile SPCX soared, legacy aerospace stocks cratered. Boeing and Lockheed Martin both saw double-digit drops as the market effectively declared the traditional launch industry dead. \n\nWarning lights are also flashing for telecom giants like Comcast and AT&T, who are bleeding subscribers to Starlink's new \"Direct-to-Brain\" gigabit service.\n\n## 🔮 Conclusion\n\nToday, Wall Street bet $5 trillion that humanity is going multi-planetary. The risk is high, but as of today, the reward is infinite."
